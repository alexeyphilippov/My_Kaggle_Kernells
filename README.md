# My_Kaggle_Kernells
Here I'm gonna be placing my kernels for DS competitions Kaggle.

For now you can find here only kernel for Quora Insincere Questions Classification competition.

You can also take a look at how it was ran on Kaggle:

The main feature of my kernels is LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDA.
I used this approach to create extra features. Those features are referred to as an distribution of topics over documents.
So basicly it is an OHE for toplics in question.

You can also find here different examples of word embeddings like GloVe, word2vec, TF-IDF.

I did not pay much ettnetion to predictive models themselves, as my purpose in this competition was to apply a nice and robust 
data preprocessing.
